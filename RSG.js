Each utility should consider many different options and the range of possible benefits to develop a comprehensive plan that satisfies utility needs without overstretching resources. Resilience planning is not a new or separate effort for utilities. Strategies can provide greater resilience along with other benefits, such as more efficient operations, cost savings, and maintenance of adequate, high-quality water supply.

Several technical and informational resources are required to support planning. For example, inundation maps, precipitation data and flood models may all be needed to determine thresholds for damage and assess options to mitigate loss. An integral part of increasing utility resilience is to conduct a risk assessment and adopt an associated decision-support framework.
